======

Lightweight value type C++ classes to represent real quantities of money and world currencies defined by ISO 4217. The money class contains a fixed-point numerical value and a currency denomination, together fitting into 64 bits (same size as C double). The numerical "point" is floating across different currencies, automatically adjusting the numerical precision to the the smallest unit of real money per the ISO 4217 currency.

http://ref.castedo.com/isomon/ is a distribution of the documentation built from C++ and [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) files in the repository.
